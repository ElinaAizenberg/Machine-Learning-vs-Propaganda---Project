# Machine Learning vs. Propaganda

<img src="pictures/WordCloud.png" width="700"> 

Russian propaganda machine struggles to persuade each and every citizen of the country that the primary goal of the Western World or Collective West, especially, of the United States of America is to destroy our traditional values, impose on Russians 'their western tolerance' and shatter Russian govermental system. Somehow. According to popogandists' logic, all Americans are either terrified with Russians (these are democrats) or extrmely envy and admire our unique and brave nation (these are republicans).

**But, do Americans really talk so much about Russia as we are being persuaded? Are they worried, afraid of or pay no attention to the far far country somewhere in the north? What exactly do they think concerning place of Russia in the modern world? Let's read Americans headlines and find out the truth.**

For this project I gathered headlines from 6 US media:

- period: 01/01/2020 - 20/04/2021;

- search results for 'Russia', so, all articles where 'Russia' was mentioned;

- media with various political views: left, lean left, center, lean right and right. 


**DISCLAIMER:**
if you notice sarcasm or snide comments in this project, please, do not take it seriously. It emerged as a response to several political and legislative innovations in Russia that aim to limit access to education, control international educational initiatives, put at risk scientists and educators or make them leave the country, lower people's awareness of the outside world. I hope sharp humor of this project will reduce the level of anxiety.
